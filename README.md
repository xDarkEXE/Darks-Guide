# Dark's GameCommands Wiki

Welcome to my gameCommands wiki, this will be filled with a lot of games that have console commands for the player to access

Currently for the moment, this is going to be a text based wiki with no images.
Due to the framework i am working with "Svelte" doesn't include any video / photo packages inside yet.

But, if you want to help me out and figure out on to add videos and photos. You're welcome to make a pull
request!

# Running it locally
